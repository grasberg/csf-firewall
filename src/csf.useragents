#   User-Agent Blocking
#
#   This file contains a list of User-Agent patterns to block. Each pattern
#   is a Perl-compatible regular expression that will be matched against the
#   User-Agent header in HTTP access log entries.
#
#   When a match is found, the IP address will be blocked according to the
#   LF_USERAGENT settings in csf.conf.
#
#   Note: The matching is case-insensitive.
#
#   Format: One pattern per line
#   
#   Lines starting with # are comments
#   Blank lines are ignored
#
#   Examples:
#       ^BadBot
#       malicious.*crawler
#       ^$
#       (curl|wget|python-requests)
#
#   WARNING: Be careful with patterns. Overly broad patterns can block
#   legitimate users. Test patterns thoroughly before deployment.
